&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anti-programmed death (PD)-1 therapy (αPD-1) has been used in patients with non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC), leading to improved outcomes. However, the outcomes of therapy are still
insufficient, and the expression of PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is not always a predictor of response to
αPD-1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immuno-cancer drugs used for treatment purposes of NSCLC are typically Kitruda and Optivo. &lt;br /&gt;
Each monthly treatment costs about $600,000 and $800,000, respectively, and costs nearly $10 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the drug doesn’t respond to all patients. Therefore, in the case of Kitruda, the ‘PD-L1 expression positive rate’ must be 50% or more to be prescribed. However, even if the conditions are satisfied and prescribed, the actual drug reaction is about 60%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I studied a drug activity prediction model using Non-FDA-approved information to help more patients get the correct prescription and reduce the cost of drug waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary-idea--solution&quot;&gt;Summary Idea &amp;amp; Solution&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clinical data including patient characteristics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mutations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Laboratory findings from the electronic medical records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-feature&quot;&gt;Data Feature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Missing values ​​exist in most features. Learning inputation models separately based on the distribution of other features and their non-missing values, rather than simple mean, zero, etc. methods.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To prevent data leakage, it was reviewed directly by the clinician.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;model-selection--evaluation&quot;&gt;Model Selection &amp;amp; Evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proceed with model selection, including linear models, to find the appropriate complexity of the model.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Due to the small number of samples, LOOCV is used for model selection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Due to the nature of the field, some explanatory power is required, so the ensemble stage to maximize performance is not performed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finding samples that appear to be somewhat outliers as a result of LOOCV. (4 samples)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;feature-attribution&quot;&gt;Feature Attribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is very likely that there is an interaction effect between data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, feature importance based on simple entropy is highly likely to cause errors in interpretation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Lime-based explanation model has a small number of samples, so it is judged that there is a lot of room for problems in fitting the local model.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For each sample, the average of the shap values ​​and the interaction value were calculated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;feature-engineering&quot;&gt;Feature engineering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gene-metastasis-feature&quot;&gt;Gene&amp;amp; Metastasis Feature&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sparsity&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When judging based on the commonly used sparsity judgment criteria, it was determined that there was sparsity by the ratio of zero value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Percentage of zero values: About $Gene Expression  \in {0,1}$,  The ratio of zero is at least 85% to a maximum of 95%. Therefore, it is judged to be sparse.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Number of observations: It does not see the sparse by observices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data Volatility: Because it is a binary, the conclusion is the same as that of Percenrage of zero. it is sparse.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Model performance: Unable to judge due to the limit of the number of samples.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Domain knowledge: Since there are no accurate statistics on gene expression for Korean, sparsity cannot be determined based on Domain knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Feature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To reduce sparsity, change the gene feature to a new feature that represents the total number of expressions of the associated gene.
\(\text{driver oncogene} = \sum{ \text{gene expression}}\)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change Metastasis to “Total Metastasis” in the same way.
\(\text{metastasis count} = \sum{ \text{metastasis present}}\)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neutrophil and Lymphocyte were replaced by the LNR (lymphocyte-to-neutrophil ratio) feature.
\(LNR = log(\frac{Neutrophil}{Lymphocyte} + \epsilon )\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;model-selection&quot;&gt;Model Selection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a comparison table of the eight models of the roc-auc score. It was evaluated with LOOCV (Leave one out CV).
It was judged that the model required for prediction did not have to be highly complex. Therefore, we did not do model ensembles and compared only single models.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/publication_patents/paper_compare.png&quot; alt=&quot;score&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Model Performance : LightGBM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/publication_patents/paper_score.png&quot; alt=&quot;score&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;feature-attribution-1&quot;&gt;Feature Attribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the average value of the SHAP value of all samples.&lt;br /&gt;
Shap is the contribution to the predicted value of a model considering the synergistic effect of one feature and another feature, from the point of view of game theory. &lt;br /&gt;
Since the data in the medical and bio fields are features that are difficult to assert independence, it was judged that SHAP value-based interpretation was appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/publication_patents/paper_shap_val.png&quot; alt=&quot;shap&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the results, I suspected that the persistence of non-measurable lesions might have a high correlation with the target value. Thus, the persistence of non-measurable lesions is an ordinary type of data, so we look at spearman correlation.
correlation = -0.44 and p-value = 8.1e-11. That is, it was not a strong relationship, so it was used as a feature.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Feature Engineering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want to see entire predictive system concept, 
see section 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want to detail of machine learning strategies, see section 5&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The data used in this work are all public data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the middle, we changed the working environment to the AWS environment. The code for this repository is still unorganized, so it can be messy. And because the data is very large, I didn’t put it in the repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;1-data&quot;&gt;1. Data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;used-dataset&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Used Dataset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CCLE basal expression &amp;amp; meta info&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;L1000 phase1, phase2 lv.5&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CTRP AUC&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DEMETER2 normalized dependency score for 515 cell lines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PANACEA gene expression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preprocessing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preprocessing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the following five data to describe the characteristics of the cell line.
Histology and basal expressions for 515 cell lines in CCLE ,
TF activity inference score and Pathway inference score were calculated from the CCLE basal expression value using Viper. PROGENy, respectively.
The NA values within the DEMETER2 score were imputed with average values per cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the data to describe the characteristics of the drug, only post-treatment expression values were used.
Signatures for overlapping 326 drugs in CTRP and L1000 are selected and only 973 experimentally measured genes were used to normalize by MODZ.
The given PANACEA expression values were also normalized by the MODZ method across the cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathcal{D_f} = \{  (x_i,y_i) \vert  f \in F\}\]

&lt;p&gt;where $y$ is auc value of perturbation, $x_i$ is feature of each sample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$\mathcal{S}$ is feature class, $\mathcal{S} = {TF,PRO,HIST,GENE,CCLE,D2_{mean} }$, $\mathcal{F}$ is  feature set, $\mathcal{F} = {f_i \vert  i \in S }$&lt;/p&gt;

\[f^* = \{ TF,HIST,GENE,CCLE,D2_{mean} \}\]

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step1-searching-similar-drugs-for-hidden-drugs&quot;&gt;Step1. Searching similar drugs for hidden drugs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we performed the gene expression signature search via spearman correlation calculation. 
As a reference data, L1000, which was signaturized for each drug through MODZ, and PANACEA was used as a query for this. The similarity between drugs was calculated by spearman correlation. We chose similar drugs with the following criteria. 
By calculating robust z-score for the similarity matrix, only drugs corresponding to more than 70% of the max value of z-score were collected for each query drug. For example, for the above method, there are 7 and 19 drugs selected as drugs similar to cmpd_KW and cmpd_WW, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;./img/z_score_thereshold.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step2-modeling--prediction&quot;&gt;Step2. Modeling &amp;amp; Prediction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown above, a drug-specific model was created using only the selected perturbations for each hidden drug.
The model approached the regression problem using the GBDT to predict the AUC value according to the cell line-drug pairs given in the CTRP and used features describing the above mentioned. 
We use CART for base learner with histogram optimized approximate greedy algorithm.  We finally found out that roughly 3000 features exhibited the best performance, and we actually saw that performance was not significantly reduced even if we reduced to 7 feature sets through dimension reduction.  The most efficient dimensional reduction model was the Autoencoder model with MSE + Correlation*0.7 as the objective, but due to the complicated analysis, we use the gradient boosting method with the CART for base learner and use a very small number of sampled features. And by overfitting each prediction model to a specific set of drugs,  final ensemble model had better generalization performance since the diversity of models increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img width=&quot;800&quot; src=&quot;./img/structure.png&quot; alt=&quot;Material Bread logo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step3-ensemble&quot;&gt;Step3. Ensemble&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For generalization performance, we implemented a model ensemble. Using the results of varying the threshold value from 20% to 90% of max with z-score as shown above, correlation between the results of each model was compared. 
To use more diverse models, eight models were finally selected in the order in which they were less correlated with each other, and the predicted results were integrated to create a final presentation file.
Detail procedure is like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\(\mathcal{M} \textrm{ is set of models,} \mathcal{M} := \{ M_1 , \cdots , M_n \}, \mathcal{D} : \mathcal{M} \times  \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{R} \textrm{ is distance function}\) 
and we define average distance over each model.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathcal{D}_{avg}(M_i) = \frac{1}{| \mathcal{M} \setminus { \{i\} }  |}  \sum_{m \in \mathcal{M} \backslash {\{i\}} } \mathcal{D}(M_i,m)\]

&lt;p&gt;next, we select candidate for ensemble .&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathcal{M}_{candidate} :=\{  \mathcal{M}_i | \mathcal{D}_{avg}(M_i) \ngeq \textrm{ 90th percentile} \}\]

&lt;p&gt;finaly, define of ensemble score is like below .&lt;/p&gt;

\[S_{ensemble} = exp( \frac{1}{|\mathcal{M}_{candidate}|}  \sum_{m \in \mathcal{M}_{candidate}} log( \mathcal{D}_{avg}(m)) )\]

&lt;p&gt; 
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;3-conclusion--discussion&quot;&gt;3. Conclusion &amp;amp; Discussion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started from the assumption that we could deduce the MoA of the drug via post-treatment gene expression on the drug.
It is difficult to predict drug sensitivities that have specific targets and specific pathways(Koras, K et al. 2020). So, we recognized the need to make models for each drug, and we tried many things, such as looking at which gene has high coefficient for each drug by predicting AUC with only gene expression, in addition to the methods described above. Our experiments have also shown that it is better to make a model for each drugs than to use one model predicting the AUC for all drugs.
Each cell line has its own unique characteristics, so it is very meaningful to use it as a feature that can explain it. Predicting the drug sensitivities for each cell line will be very useful in selecting cell lines in experimental screening and also valuable in the field of new drug development in reducing costs.
Since we didn’t have enough time to find the optimal model, we had no choice but to use the naive experimental results, so I think we can improve the predictive performance through more accurate experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;5-feature-engineering&quot;&gt;5. Feature Engineering&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Data Integration&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;
Different public datasets have different gene types. Alternatively, you can use a gene set that you deem valid based on domain knowledge. Strategies other than intersection result in missing value unconditionally. Therefore, the method of imputating the missing value must also be selected.     &lt;br /&gt;
 In this project, we compared two methods using gene sets judged to be valid through intersection and paper search, and found that the performance of intersection is similar. Therefore, we used an intersection geneset with a small data size. (973 genes.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Demesional reduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unable to find any studies for manifolds of data between total expression amount + chemical reaction amount. Therefore, Autoencoder was used.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use cosine similarity and pearsons R as the evaluation metric. In a situation where the process of generating genetic data is not guaranteed to be the same, it is difficult to normalize when operating between different dataset. Therefore, Cosine similarity was used as the main and Pearson correlation coefficient was used as an adjunct.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VAE vs AE comparison. (see ‘/code_clean/st_04_mapping_drug_378norm_ctrp_auto_encoder/’)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;./img/vae_ae.png&quot; alt=&quot;Material Bread logo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why perform demesional reduction and use cosine similarity for AE?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
-&amp;gt; I found that the genomic data we use is biased by sequencing machines and processes in training machine learning models. This was previously based on cancer tumor classification tests and genomic data.  &lt;br /&gt;
 
These differences mainly occur in relative expression amounts, and it was experimentally found that the types of genes expressed are generally consistent.  &lt;br /&gt;
 
This is why I used AE and cosine similarity as an evaluation metric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Why not UMAP(Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 -&amp;gt; In the case of UMAP, it is necessary to design a quality evaluation method of the pre-distance metric, search for the optimal metric, and optimize the projection parameters. And since the model description is not necessary for this competition, it was not used for the sake of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Why not linear dimensionality reduction (like PCA, NMF)?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
 -&amp;gt; Because the data is high-dimensional and sparse, the linear method does not fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3. DNN encoder feature&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;
-&amp;gt; It is a method determined in the engineering process to create optimal features.  &lt;br /&gt;
 
Experimentally tried several feature engineering and applied them because we achieved the best CV-score.&lt;/p&gt;
